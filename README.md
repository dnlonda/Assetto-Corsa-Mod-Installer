# Assetto-Corsa-Mod-Installer

Unzips and Installs Assetto Corsa mods after downloading

literally just started working on this

if you download a mod off the internet, this app should copy the zip file to another folder for backup later, unzip the file into a folder, then move the unzipped file to the game files. 

You will need to specify if the file is a car, track, or something else or it will be installed into the wrong location.
